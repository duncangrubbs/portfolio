          BarterOut is a web application that focuses on making peer-to-peer
          used textbook transactions easier. For the last year, I have worked in
          a small team building the client-side of the site, as well as the API
          (backend) infrastructure.

        <p className="mt-2">
          Recently, I returned to a project I had started a few years ago with
          the hope of rebuilding the API in a more robust, clean way, while
          still retaining the ideas I had about the app in the first place. I
          wanted to work in a test driven way, focusing on making my code clean
          and testable.
