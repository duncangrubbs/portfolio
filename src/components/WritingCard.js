    <div className="writingcard__content">
    America has always championed open political discourse and diversity of beliefs, but recently, scholars have begun to see a concerning trend in the movement of Americansâ€™ beliefs. This trend can be described as political polarization, and the resulting changes have undermined healthy political discussions and thought in the American public. Without these key factors of democracy, the U.S. government has become much more partisan and has moved slower to provide basic resources and policy to the public. While there are many proposed causes of these issues, research points to the popularization of the internet and the resulting changes to the media as a large factor in the increasing severity of this political polarization.
