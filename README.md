# Portfolio

> My personal website, built with React.js

### Overview
Yes, React.js is overkill for a static, portfolio website.
However, I am using this site as a demostration of my
knowledge in web development fundementals and best
practices, expressed in the use of the following tools.

### Tools Used
- Built With [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- Uses [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) CSS style
- Github pages for hosting

### Commands
- `npm start` to start dev server
- `npm run build` to build
- `npm run deploy` to deploy (requires auth)
