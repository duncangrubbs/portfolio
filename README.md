# Portfolio

> My personal website, but built with React.js

However, I am using this site as a demostration of my
knowledge in web development fundementals and best
practices, expressed in the use of the following tools.

### Tools Used

- [surge.sh](https://surge.sh) for hosting

### Commands

- `yarn build` to build
