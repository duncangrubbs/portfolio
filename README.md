> My personal website, built with React

### Overview
React is certainly overkill for a static portfolio website.
However, I am using this site as a demonstration of my
knowledge in web development fundementals and best
practices, expressed in the use of the following tools.

### Tools Used
- Built With [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- Uses [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) CSS style
- Vercel for hosting

### Commands
- `npm start` to start dev server
- `npm run build` to build
