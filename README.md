# react-io

> My personal website, but re-built with React.js

### Overview
Yes, React.js is overkill for a static, personal website.
However, I am using this site as a demostration of my
knowledge in web development fundementals and best
practices, expressed in the use of the following tools.

### Tools Used:
- Built With [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- Tested with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- Linted with [eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- Uses [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) CSS style
- [surge.sh](https://surge.sh) for hosting

### Instructions:
- `yarn start` to start dev server
- `yarn build` to build
- `yarn deploy` to deploy (you must be authorized for this)
